# Part 1

 Ask the user for the user’s first name
 Ask the user for the user’s last name
 Ask the user for the user’s age
 Ask the user for the user’s birth month (as an 'int')
 Ask the user for the user’s favorite ROYGBIV color
 If the user does not know what ROYGBIV is, ask them to enter “Help” to get a list of the ROYGBIV colors
 Ask the user for the number of siblings the user has

# Part 2

 If the user’s age is an odd number, then they will retire in ____ years, or ___ years if their age is an even number.
 If the user’s number of siblings is 0, then they will have a vacation home in ____ (location), or 1 then they will have a vacation home in ____ (location), or 2 then they will have a vacation home in ____ (location), or 3 then they will have a vacation home in ____ (location), or more than 3 then they will have a vacation home in ____ (location). If the user enters anything other than a number greater than or equal to 0, they should get a bad vacation home!
 Depending on which ROYGBIV color is the user’s favorite, they will have a specific mode of transportation (i.e. car, boat, plane, etc.)
 If the user’s birth month is 1-4, they will have $____ in the bank; if the user's birth month is 5-8, they will have $____ in the bank; and if it is 9-12, then they will have $____ in the bank. If the user enters something other than 1-12 as their birth month, they will have $0.00 in the bank.

# Part 3

 The user’s fortune should be written as such:
 [First Name] [Last Name] will retire in [# of Years] with [Amount of Money] in the bank, a vacation home in [Location] and a [Mode of Transportation].
 Program should be able to handle whether or not a user inputs capital or lowercase letters.
